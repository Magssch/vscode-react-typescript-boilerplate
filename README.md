# React TypeScript boilerplate

A VSCode extension containing snippets for `.tsx` files. Contains the following snippets for creating boilerplate code for React with TypeScript:

- `treact`: Stateless React Functional Component with no props
- `treactprops`: Stateless React Functional Component with props and interface
- `treactstate`: React Functional Component with props and interface, in addition to a derived state using useState and useEffect hooks

Install from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Magssch.react-typescript-boilerplate)

## How to use

Create a new `.tsx` file and type `treact`. Choose your preferred boilerplate and press `enter`. The snippets contain multiple variables that can be customized in order to quickly setup a component. The first variable will always be the name of the component. Press `tab` to confirm the value of a variable and proceed to the next one.
